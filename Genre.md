# Similarities Across Genres
All of these genres require you to maintain a professional tone. When writing across these genres, you want to maintain the 7C's (See more in the 7C's section). 
Remaining clear and concise are vital to professional communication. For emails, you want to avoid anything longer than a paragraph. Cover letters and resumes
shouldn't be any longer than a page. Formal reports and external communication should avoid buisness jargon because they defeat their own purpose if the intended
audience cannot understand them. 

# Genre Settings
We are all familar with emails, but emails serve a different purpose depending on the setting. A professional email is going to be a lot different than an email you
send to a friend. They need to be short and quick. A lot of people use emails for a purpose that better suits a memo. Resumes do not need ot be your whole work history,
you should make sure the content is relevant to the position you are applying for. Remeber, most employeers only look at your resume for an average of 6 seconds! What do
you want them to see and know? These are just a few examples of how a genre can change within a professional setting.
